Our final project is a field goal kicking game. 
From a user's perspective, the user would run a make file.
And the program compiles and the game starts. 
The user presses the spacebar to launch the ball in the direction of the arrow which will be rotating back and forth.
The user is given 3 lives to begin with and gets a bonus life for every 100 points the user scores.
After scoring or missing the position of the arrow and the ball would be shifted to the left and to the right of the initial central position.
After the 3 parts if the user still has a life the user would advance to the next level. 
After reaching level 3 , if the user still has a life and completes all three parts the program reverts back to level 1.
If the user has 0 lives left a game over text with the options of pressing q or r it appears. 
From the programmers perspective, we used the libraries unistd.h, math.h, gfxnew.h, cstring, string and our own class called background to create the game.
Our background class has a method to set the background based on the level. It uses the gfxnew.h library to draw the background for the game. 
In our main driver we animate a ball and  an arrow pointing in the direction of where the ball would move.
We called our background in the while loop and is initially set to level 1 and ball and arrow will be in the center which is part 1. 
We used a bunch of if statements with in a while loop in order to set conditions for scoring,losing and also updating score, life, level and part.
We ran the game and tested our conditions using different positions of the ball and saw that it responds accordingly.
